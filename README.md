Experiments of IDless person identification with AI

## TODO
- Take a look at training datasets http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/ and https://cswww.essex.ac.uk/mv/allfaces/index.html or this one http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/publications/2018/Cao18/cao18.pdf
- Investigate similar implementations (https://hackernoon.com/facial-similarity-with-siamese-networks-in-pytorch-9642aa9db2f7, https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-train-your-own-faceid-cnn-using-tensorflow-eager-execution-6905afe4fd5a, https://becominghuman.ai/siamese-networks-algorithm-applications-and-pytorch-implementation-4ffa3304c18) to build own one
