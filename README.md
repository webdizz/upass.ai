Experiments of IDless person identification with AI

## TODO
- ~~Take a look at training dataset [VGGFace2](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/vgg_face2/)~~
- ~~Pre-process dataset to enable it to be loaded into fastai Learner~~
- ~~Investigate similar implementations (https://hackernoon.com/facial-similarity-with-siamese-networks-in-pytorch-9642aa9db2f7, https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-train-your-own-faceid-cnn-using-tensorflow-eager-execution-6905afe4fd5a, https://becominghuman.ai/siamese-networks-algorithm-applications-and-pytorch-implementation-4ffa3304c18) to build own one~~
- Train model
- Collect private dataset
